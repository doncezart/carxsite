## Run locally

After you downloaded the repository, you can get it up and running using the following commands:
```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

If you use pnpm package manager, use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install` in the previous step.
When finished developing, use `npm build` to build. However, you might need to choose a proper adapter for this step. More info [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters)
